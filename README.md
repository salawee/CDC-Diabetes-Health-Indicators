# :green_book: Predictive Analytics in Public Health: Early Detection of Diabetes Using BRFSS Data

## Introduction

In the United States, diabetes remains a significant public health challenge, affecting millions and imposing substantial economic costs. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), an extensive collection of health-related data, offers a unique opportunity to harness machine learning techniques for early detection and intervention in diabetes care. 

Over the years, its prevalence has steadily increased, affecting millions of people across various demographic groups [1]. According to recent statistics, approximately 34.2 million Americans have diabetes, with an estimated 7.3 million cases going undiagnosed [2]. This surge in diabetes cases is attributed to several factors, including the aging population, sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy dietary habits, and increasing rates of obesity [3]. Diabetes disproportionately affects certain demographic groups, with higher prevalence rates observed among racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with lower socio-economic status, and those living in rural areas [4]. These disparities highlight the need for targeted interventions and public health initiatives to address the underlying social determinants of health contributing to the diabetes epidemic.

This project aims to apply advanced predictive analytics to the BRFSS 2015 dataset to identify early indicators of diabetes and prediabetes. Through the use of several machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines, this study evaluates the capability of survey data to predict individual diabetes risk effectively. The research focuses on comparing the effectiveness of these models in various configurations, assessing their performance with and without feature selection to determine the most predictive risk factors. By doing so, the project seeks to develop a shortened, optimized survey that could be implemented in routine screenings to enhance early detection rates. The ultimate goal is to contribute to public health strategies, potentially leading to better patient outcomes through earlier interventions and to provide a cost-effective tool for widespread diabetes risk screening.
